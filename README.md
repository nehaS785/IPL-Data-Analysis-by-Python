# IPL-Data-Analysis-by-Python
This project analyzes IPL match data using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover trends in team performance, total runs, and match outcomes. The Jupyter Notebook includes data processing, visualization, and insights into key IPL statistics.

## Project Objective
Analyze the total runs scored by each team.Identify top-performing teams and players.Visualize match statistics using graphs and charts.Discover trends and patterns in IPL matches.

## Technologies Used
1. Python – Programming language used for data analysis.
2. Pandas – For data handling and manipulation.
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn – For creating visualizations.
4. Jupyter Notebook – For interactive coding and analysis.

## Key-Insights
1. Total Runs by Each Batting Team- The analysis aggregates the total runs scored by each team and visualizes it using a bar plot.
2. Wides Bowled by Each Bowling Team - The notebook calculates and visualizes the number of wide balls bowled by each team.
3. Average Runs Per Inning by Each Team - The notebook calculates the average runs scored per inning for each team and presents it using a bar chart.
4. Top Batsmen by Total Runs - It identifies the top 10 batsmen with the highest runs in IPL history and visualizes them in a bar chart.
5. Types of Dismissals - The analysis counts different types of dismissals (bowled, caught, LBW, etc.) and displays their distribution.

# Recommendations

## For Team :

Optimize Batting Order:
1. Teams with lower average runs per inning should analyze their top-order performance. Promoting consistent run-scorers to the top can improve total scores.
2. Minimize Extras (Wides & No-Balls):
3. If a team has bowled a high number of wides, coaches should focus on disciplined bowling strategies in practice sessions.

Target Weak Bowling Attacks:
1. If a specific bowling team concedes more runs, opposing teams should be aggressive against them and build strategies accordingly.

## For Players:

Enhance Powerplay Performance:

1. Players should improve strike rates in powerplay overs to give their teams a strong start, particularly against teams with weak new-ball bowlers.
2. Better Bowling in Death Overs:
3. If certain bowlers are conceding more runs in the final overs, they should focus on yorkers and variations like slower balls.

* Adapt to Dismissal Patterns:
Batsmen frequently dismissed by a particular method (e.g., caught behind, LBW) should refine their techniques to minimize weaknesses.

## For Strategies:
Match-Winning Partnerships:

1. Teams should focus on partnerships that have historically performed well, pairing batsmen who complement each other’s styles.

* Data-Driven Team Selection:
4. Before each match, selecting players based on historical performance against specific teams and venues can increase the chances of winning.
